Module Name:
  CpuIo.h

Abstract:
  *.h file for the driver

  Note: the EFIAPI on the CpuIo functions is used to glue MASM (assembler) code
  into C code. By making the MASM functions EFIAPI it ensures that a standard
  C calling convention is assumed by the compiler, reguardless of the compiler
  flags.
