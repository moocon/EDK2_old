#/** @file
# Timer Library implementation for Boot Timer moudles that require timer services.
#
# Timer Library that uses CPU resources to provide calibrated
#  delays on IA-32 and x64, and uses ITC on IPF. Note: Because CpuLocalApci
#  and ITC could be programmed by OS, it cannot be used by SMM drivers
#  and runtime drivers, ACPI timer is recommended for SMM drivers and RUNTIME
#  drivers.
