/**
  Locates a requested firmware section within a file and returns it to a buffer allocated by this function. 

  PiLibGetSectionFromAnyFv () is used to read a specific section from a file within a firmware volume. The function
  will search the first file with the specified name in all firmware volumes in the system. The search order for firmware 
  volumes in the system is determistic but abitrary if no new firmware volume is added into the system between 
  each calls of this function. 

  After the specific file is located, the function searches the specifc firmware section with type SectionType in this file. 
  The details of this search order is defined in description of EFI_FIRMWARE_VOLUME2_PROTOCOL.ReadSection () 
  found in PI Specification.

  If SectionType is EFI_SECTION_TE, EFI_SECTION_TE is used as section type to start the search. If EFI_SECTION_TE section 
  is not found, EFI_SECTION_PE32 will be used to try the search again. If no EFI_SECTION_PE32 section is found, EFI_NOT_FOUND 
  is returned.
