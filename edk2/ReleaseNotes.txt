-----------------------
Notes On Required Tools (MS Windows environment example)
-----------------------
Software Installation Order:
  After installing the compiler tools and your Subversion client, the following
  required tools should be installed in order: 
    Java JDK, Apache-Ant, ant-contrib, xmlbeans, saxon8

Java Development Kit:
 
   The Java Environment Variable must be set before attempting to build.
       i.e. For Sun JDK (see note below*):
              set JAVA_HOME=c:\ Java\jdk1.5.0_06  
       i.e. For Bea Systems:
              set JAVA_HOME=c:\Program Files\Java\jrockit-R26.0.0-jdk1.5.0_04
 
  *When using the Sun JDK5.0
    During installation, you should specify the install directory as C:\Java
    instead of C:\Program Files\(or some other drive letter.)  While installing
    to this non-standard location is not required. In use, it seems to work 
    more reliably. 
    For the JDK, the install path would be C:\Java\jdk1.5.0_06
    For the JRE, the install path would be C:\Java\jre1.5.0_06
    Alternatively, you can specify C:\sunjavajdk and C:\sunjavajre.

    NOTE: You cannot combine the location for the JDK and the JRE, as the JRE
    install removes most of the binaries and libraries installed by the JDK
    install.

Java Tools:
    The Apache-ANT requires the ANT_HOME environment variable to be set before
    attempting to build:
         i.e.  set ANT_HOME=c:\<full path to where ant was installed>

    The ant-contrib.jar file should be installed in the %ANT_HOME%\lib 
    directory.

    The XMLBeans, requires the XMLBEANS_HOME environment variable to be set
    before attempting to build:
         i.e. set XMLBEANS_HOME=C:\<full path to where xmlbeans  was installed>

    The saxon8.jar file should be copied to the %XMLBEANS_HOME%\lib directory.

   The Ant and XMLBean tools are required to be in the path.
     MS system example:
        set PATH=%PATH%;%ANT_HOME%\bin;%XMLBEANS_HOME%\bin
     Linux/OS X bash shell example:
        export PATH=$PATH:${ANT_HOME}/bin:${XMLBEANS_HOME}/bin
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Quick Start
-----------
Edit the text file, target.txt, located in the Tools/Conf directory. This 
file contains the tools defintion file and ative platform. It can also restrict
current build target(s), tagname(s) and arch(s). Uncomment the line ACTIVE_PLATFORM
which is commented out by default. 

Edit the tools definition file, tools_def.txt, also located in the Tools/Conf 
directory. This file contains the names of the compiler tool chains and the 
location of the compiler binaries.  It has been pre-populated with the standard 
location for the Microsoft tool chains and includes the standard location of 
the Intel C Compiler for EFI Byte Code (EBC)
  
Follow the instructions at https://edk2.tianocore.org/servlets/ProjectSource to
checkout the entire EDK II source tree.

In a command window, change to the top level directory of the Edk II sources.
  Set the WORKSPACE environment variable, e.g.:

    c:\> set WORKSPACE=C:\MyWork\Edk2.0

To test your tool chain setup and to build the Supplied Tools, execute:
    c:\MyWork\Edk2.0\> edksetup

(This command will be referred to as the setup command throughout the rest of
this document.)
      NOTE: You should run the setup command at the start of every session.
            This configures the environment to include the TianoTools and the
            Java applications and libraries.

Once this is completed, you are ready to test the Build, by executing:
    c:\MyWork\Edk2.0\> build

This command builds active platform specified in text file target.txt. If 
active platform is not specified, go to sub-directory which contains FPD files and
type build. More information about active platform policy reference to specification
<<EDK II Build and Packaging Architecture Specification>>.

-------------------------
Individual Platform Builds
-------------------------
After running the setup command, you can build individual platforms.
  In the command window, 
  1. Set active platform in target.txt, and type "build" in whatever directory;
  2. or cd to the platform (FPD file) that you want to build, and just type:
    c:\MyWork\Edk2.0\EdkNt32Pkg\> build

  Note that active platform with the high priority to build, that means active 
  platform will be built even if exists FPD file under current directory. More 
  information about active platform policy reference to specification
  <<EDK II Build and Packaging Architecture Specification>>. 

Go to <full build path>\Debug\MSFT\IA32 and execute SecMain.exe
to run the Nt32 emulation platform under Microsoft Windows.

To exit the Nt32 emulation platform, you may type reset at the EFI Shell>
command prompt.  Alternately, you may use the Graphical interface, Boot
Maintenance Manager screen's Reset System command.

------------------------
Individual Module Builds
------------------------
After running the setup command, you can build individual modules.
  In the command window, cd to the module that you want to build, and just
  type:
    c:\MyWork\Edk2.0\MdePkg\Library\BaseLib\> build

  Note active platform must be set for individual module build. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A Word on Apache-ANT
--------------------
The Apache-ANT program is a build tool that uses XML-based project files.
Similar to Makefiles, these project files may contain multiple targets.  Most
build.xml files in Edk2.0 are auto-generated; any edits performed on the
build.xml files will be overwritten the next time ant is executed.

Pre-defined targets in the build.xml files include:
    all      - This target builds binaries for defined architectures
    clean    - This target removes object files generated by commands
    cleanall - This target removes all generated files and directories.

A Word on GCC tool chain
------------------------
EDK2 will not compile with a standard Linux gcc tool chain. While Linux
distributions are usually based on ELF, EDK2 requires a version of gcc that is
configured to produce PE-COFF images. You will find a script in edk2/Tools/gcc
that will download, configure, compile, and install a gcc 4.X cross-compile
tool chain for EDK2 development. It has support for the ia32 architecture. It
can be built and run on Cygwin, Linux, and many other POSIX compliant host
operating environments. There are a few tools that you will need on your host
computer in order to compile the tool chain. Among them are bash, gcc, gmake,
curl (or wget).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

General Information:
===============================================================    
Mechanisms:
----------
A brief overview:

A) Surface Area Package Description (SPD) file contains information about the
modules that the package contains, including the location of all MSA files, and
public library names and headers that might be provided by a module in the
package.  Packages are defined by SPD files.  (Found in the root of the Package
subdirectory (i.e. EdkNt32Pkg)) The SPD is further explained in the "Build 
Packaging Specification" document.
 
B) Module Surface Area Definition (MSA) files.  A description of a module's 
surface area, with all module specific default flags and features specified.
Refer to the "Module Surface Area Architecture Specification" for additional
details. The MSA is further explained in the "Build Packaging Specification"
document.
 
C) Module Build Description (MDB). The "as-built" definition file that contains
only the changes to the default flags defined in the MSA. The MSA and MDB are
further explained in the "Build Packaging Specification" document.

D) Platform Configuration Database (PCD).  A platform database which contains a
variety of current platform settings or directives by which a driver or
application can interact with.  The PCD is defined by the PCD_Protocol (This is
further explained in the "Platform Configuration Database Infrastructure 
Description" document.

E) Library Class.  A library class is a logical grouping of similar functions.
When developing components, the module surface area declares the class of
libraries that can be used by the component. The MBD file specifies the
instance(s) of the library that will be used during compilation/linking. All
library type modules must include header files in their distribution package,
as well as their surface area and module build description files. Components,
on the other hand, need only provide the binary and build description files
when distributing BINARY packages.  The Library Classes are further explained
in the "Build Packaging Specification" document.

=========================================================================
The common operations by developers of new modules are:
-------------------------------------------------------

1) How to manually create a new module in a package:
  - The module source code must first be created in an appropriate directory
    (under the package the module is to be a part of.)  
  - An MSA file must be created, spelling out all aspects of the module.
  - The MSA must be added to the SPD for the package to include the module.

-----------------------------------------
2) Add/Remove module(s) to/from a package:

  - Setup environment as Build
  - Add a module to a package
     * Generate the module SurfaceArea description file
     * Add a new <Filename> element under <MsaFiles> into
       <PackageDir>\<PackageName>.spd, using relative path to package
     * Add a new <ModuleSA> entry under each <FrameworkModules> into
       <PackageDir>\<PackageName>.fpd file if necessary. 

   - Remove a module from a package
     * Comment out or remove corresponding <Filename> element under <MsaFiles>
       from <PackageDir>\<PackageName>.spd
     * Comment out or remove corresponding <ModuleSA> entry under each
       <FrameworkModules> from <PackageDir>\<PackageName>.fpd if necessary. 

-----------------------------------
3) How to manually create a package:
  - Identify the modules that are to be members of the project.
  - Identify the Variables and Guids required in and of the Package (including
    consumption/production information).
  - Create an SPD file defining these modules and calling out their MSA files.
  - add a new <Filename> element under <PackageList> into 
    Tools\Conf\FrameworkDatabase.db, using the relative path to workspace. 

--------------------------------------
4) Declare a new Protocol in a package: 
  - This release requires manual editing of the SPD file, adding the protocol
    to the ProtocolDeclarations section of the file. 
  - Add the Protocol .h file to the Include\Protocol directory.
  - Add an <Entry> to the <ProtocolDeclarations> element in the 
    <PackageName>.spd file
     * Each line contains Protocol base name then the global variable name and
       then the hex value of the Protocol GUID.

Example Protocol Entries (NOTE: The Guid entry is a single line in the SPD file):
<ProtocolDeclarations>
  <Entry Name="Bds">
    <C_Name>gEfiBdsArchProtocolGuid</C_Name>
    <GuidValue>665E3FF6-46CC-11D4-9A38-0090273FC14D</GuidValue>
    <HelpText/>
  </Entry>
  <Entry Name="Cpu">
    <C_Name>gEfiCpuArchProtocolGuid</C_Name>
    <GuidValue>26BACCB1-6F42-11D4-BCE7-0080C73C8881</GuidValue>
    <HelpText/>
  </Entry>
</ProtocolDeclarations>

---------------------------------
5) Declare a new PPI in a package:
 - This release requires manual editing of the SPD file
  - Add the PPI .h file to the Include\Ppi directory.
  - Add an <Entry> to the package <PpiDeclarations> element in the 
    <PackageName>.spd file
     * Each line contains PPI base name then the global variable name and then
       the hex value of the PPI GUID.

Example Ppi Entries (NOTE: The Guid entry is a single line in the SPD file):
<PpiDeclarations>
  <Entry Name="BootInRecoveryMode">
    <C_Name>gEfiPeiBootInRecoveryModePpiGuid</C_Name>
    <GuidValue>17EE496A-D8E4-4B9A-94D1-CE8272300850</GuidValue>
    <HelpText/>
  </Entry>
  <Entry Name="CpuIo">
    <C_Name>gEfiPeiCpuIoPpiInServiceTableGuid</C_Name>
    <GuidValue>E6AF1F7B-FC3F-46DA-A828-A3B457A44282</GuidValue>
    <HelpText/>
  </Entry>
</PpiDeclarations>

----------------------------------
6) Declare a new GUID in a package:
  - This release requires manual editing of the SPD file to include the new
    Guid.  This is identical to adding a ProtocolDeclaration or PpiDeclaration
    element as described above.

--------------------------------------- 
7) Define a new PCD entry in a package:
  - This release requires manual editing of the SPD file to include the new
    PCD.  New Pcd entries are added to the PcdDefinitions section of the
    <PackageName>.spd file using the following example for the format:
    NOTE: The hex <Token> value must be unique.

<PcdDefinitions>
  <PcdEntry ItemType="FIXED_AT_BUILD">
    <C_Name>PcdMaximumUnicodeStringLength</C_Name>
    <Token>0x00000001</Token>
    <DatumType>UINT32</DatumType>
    <DefaultValue>1000000</DefaultValue>
  </PcdEntry>
</PcdDefinition>
  
------------------------------
8) Declare a new Library Class:
  - This release requires manual editing of the SPD file to include the new
    Library Class.  New Library Class entries are added to the 
    LibraryClassDeclarations seection of the <PackageName>.spd file using
    the following example for the format:

<LibraryClassDeclarations>
  <LibraryClass Name="BaseLib">
    <IncludeHeader>Include/Library/BaseLib.h</IncludeHeader>
    <HelpText/>
  </LibraryClass>
  <LibraryClass Name="BaseMemoryLib">
    <IncludeHeader>Include/Library/BaseMemoryLib.h</IncludeHeader>
    <HelpText/>
  </LibraryClass>
</LibraryClassDeclarations>

=======================================================
Notes:
------
The EDK II represents significant changes in the structure of the EDK.
Therefore it is very difficult to isolate all of the changes of this version of
the EDK with the previous (EDK 1.0) version.

Of particular note:

1) EDK II contains new hardware feature support for the ICH SMBUS Libraries.
   These libraries are provided to make Memory Reference Code (MRC) development
   easier.
2) The MDE Libraries - The MDE libraries represent significant changes in source
   (with only limited changes in functionality.)  These new libraries conform
   to the "MDE Library Specification". 
3) The Fat Binary and the EDK Shell Binary Packages are functionally identical
   to the EDK 1.0 version.
4) The EDK tools directory has been expanded to include more tools and more
   tool functionality.
5) The EDK NT32 section has been ported to the new build process, but
   functionally remains the same as the EDK 1.0 version.
6) The Application "HelloWorld" has been ported to EDK II as well.
