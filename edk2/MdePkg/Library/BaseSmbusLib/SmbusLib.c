/**
  Executes an SMBUS block command.

  Executes an SMBUS block read, block write and block write-block read command
  on the SMBUS device specified by SmBusAddress.
  Bytes are read from the SMBUS and stored in Buffer.
  The number of bytes read is returned, and will never return a value larger than 32-bytes.
  If Status is not NULL, then the status of the executed command is returned in Status.
  It is the caller's responsibility to make sure Buffer is large enough for the total number of bytes read.
  SMBUS supports a maximum transfer size of 32 bytes, so Buffer does not need to be any larger than 32 bytes.

  @param  HostControl     The value of Host Control Register to set.  
  @param  SmBusAddress    Address that encodes the SMBUS Slave Address,
                          SMBUS Command, SMBUS Data Length, and PEC.
  @param  WriteBuffer     Pointer to the buffer of bytes to write to the SMBUS.
  @param  ReadBuffer      Pointer to the buffer of bytes to read from the SMBUS.
  @param  Status          Return status for the executed command.
                          This is an optional parameter and may be NULL.
