    <h2>Welcome to the home of EDK 2.0 Development!</h2>

    <p>

    If you are new to the project, welcome! We are still in heavy development,
    but we would invite you to take a look at what we have done so far.

    <p>

    Your feedback is critical to making EDK 2.0 a success! Please submit any
    enhancements, defects, or requests through the Project Tracker tool.

    <h2> Getting Started </h2>

    <p>

    To get the code please follow this <a
    href="https://edk2.tianocore.org/files/documents/64/239/edk2-subversion-setup.pdf">document</a>.
    It will walk you through the installation of the Subversion Software configuration 
    Management Client, TortoiseSVN, and show you how to pull the latest copy of
    the tree.

    <p>

    There are some external tools that you will need to install in order to
    build the EDK2 project. Please see the <a
    href="https://edk2.tianocore.org/installation.html#Requirements"> External
    Requirements</a>.

    <p>

    Further instructions for installing these tools are provided in the
    ReleaseNotes.txt at the top of the edk2 tree.

    <p>

    It is necessary to read through the release notes in order to find out what
    you can do with the EDK 2.0 at this stage. You will find them at the top of
    the tree that you get from our source repository.

    If you have questions about the code, please post a note on the
    <a href="mailto:dev@edk2.tianocore.org"> dev@edk2.tianocore.org </a> mailing list. One of our friendly developers will be
