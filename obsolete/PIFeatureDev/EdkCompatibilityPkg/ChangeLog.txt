		Possible Impacts:
		1) All modules that used this PPI A should be updated.

==========================================================================================
EDK_0000: Compatible: owner

==========================================================================================
EDK_r4955: Non-Compatible: qhuang8
	
	Class_HFile: Update the Device Type Value of MEDIA_FV_DP & MEDIA_FV_FILEPATH_DP.
	The definitions in MdePkg have already been updated in r4632. This will remove the
        potential compatibility issues when native EDK II modules & EDK modules built with
        ECP and run with EDK II core.  

	Code Change:
	1) Reverse the value of MEDIA_FV_DP & MEDIA_FV_FILEPATH_DP to fix a UEFI errata. 


	Possible impact:
	1) EDK I modules built with this update might not work with old EDK environment. 	


==========================================================================================
EDK_r4960: Non-Compatible: qhuang8
	
	Class_HFile: Remove the default value 0xE0000000 of EDKII_GLUE_PciExpressBaseAddress.
	It now requires platform DSC file to specify it explicitly to avoid runtime issue
        if they ever uses PciExpressLib in EDK GlueLib.
        Unlike other default value in GlueLib, this value might not function for all real
        platforms.   

	Code Change:
	1) Replace 0xE0000000 to be PCD_EDKII_GLUE_PciExpressBaseAddress. 

	Possible impact:
	1) If a platform ever uses PciExpressLib in Glue Lib. It needs to explictly specify
	the value of PCD_EDKII_GLUE_PciExpressBaseAddress for their platform to function.
	e.g. in EDK II DSC file to build EDK modules: 
       	[BuildOptions]
          *_*_*_CC_FLAGS = /D PCD_EDKII_GLUE_PciExpressBaseAddress=0xC0000000
