<h2 class="sub-heading">
	OVMF Questions and Answers:
</h2>
<p class="q-and-a">
	<b>Q: What is Open Virtual Machine Firmware (OVMF)?</b>
</p>
<p class="q-and-a">
	<b>A</b>: OVMF is a project to enable support for UEFI within Virtual Machines. 
	It is built upon the <a href="https://edk2.tianocore.org">EDK II</a> code base.
</p>
<p class="q-and-a">
	<b>Q: What source code license does OVMF use?</b>
</p>
<p class="q-and-a">
	<b>A</b>: OVMF follows the <a href="https://edk2.tianocore.org">EDK II</a> project 
	in using the open source <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php">BSD 
		license</a>.
</p>
<p class="q-and-a">
	Note: A binary of the <a href="https://fat-driver2.tianocore.org/">UEFI FAT</a> 
	driver may be included with OVMF builds, and has a slightly modified BSD 
	license.
</p>
<p class="q-and-a">
	<b>Q: What does OVMF provide?</b>
</p>
<p class="q-and-a">
	<b>A</b>: OVMF provides the following:
	<UL>
		<LI>
		Libraries and drivers related to virtual machines
		<LI>
			An entire firmware implementation with supports UEFI on open source virtual 
			machines.</LI>
	</UL>
<P></P>
<p class="q-and-a">
	<b>Q: Are OVMF releases fully UEFI compliant?</b>
</p>
<p class="q-and-a">
	<b>A</b>: While the goal is to be as fully UEFI compliant as possible, you 
	should not assume that an OVMF release is fully UEFI compliant unless the 
	particular release states full compliance.
</p>
<p class="q-and-a">
	For virtual machines, there are some challenging areas in achieving full UEFI 
	compliance. For example, UEFI 'non-volatile' variables may be difficult to 
	fully support in some virtual machine environments if a flash memory device is 
	not emulated.
</p>
<p class="q-and-a">
	<b>Q: Does OVMF support legacy booting, legacy option ROMs, CSM?</b>
</p>
<p class="q-and-a">
	<b>A</b>: No. While OVMF may have UEFI firmware drivers for some legacy 
	hardware, there is no planned legacy compatibility for OVMF.
</p>
<p class="q-and-a">
	One reason for this is that there is currently no open source CSM module which 
	could be used within OVMF. Another reason is that we would like to use OVMF to 
	help drive out some legacy assumptions which might be made by software layers 
	above the system firmware.
</p>
<p class="q-and-a">
	<b>Q: What quality level is the OVMF code? (Alpha, Beta, Production?)</b>
</p>
<p class="q-and-a">
	<b>A</b>: The quality level of the OvmfPkg within the edk2 source code 
	repository may change over time. Therefore, the best way to determine the 
	current quality level of the source repository is to look at the README 
	document under the OvmfPkg source directory or ask the EDK II dev email list. 
	Binary releases of OVMF may indicate a code quality level, and should also 
	indicate the versions of the source code repositories used to produce that 
	binary release.
</p>
<p class="q-and-a">
	<b>Q: What virtual machines are supported by the OVMF firmware builds?</b>
</p>
<p class="q-and-a">
	<b>A</b>: Hopefully this will improve over time, but initially the QEMU virtual 
	machine will be supported while emulating a IA32 (x86) or X64 (x86-64) based 
	system. The README text file included under the OvmfPkg source tree should 
	contain the most up to date list of supported virtual machine environments. The 
	README text file included with binary releases should also document the 
	supported virtual machine environments which are supported for that release.
</p>
<p class="q-and-a">
	<b>Q: Are only open source virtual machines supported?</b>
</p>
<p class="q-and-a">
	<b>A</b>: Certainly not. We have chosen the BSD license to enable easy 
	incorporation of any of the piece of our code within nearly any type of 
	product.
</p>
<p class="q-and-a">
	But, it is likely that the firmware images produced by OvmfPkg under edk2 will 
	only support open source virtual machines.
</p>
<p class="q-and-a">
	<b>Q: How can I use OVMF with a VM?</b>
</p>
<p class="q-and-a">
	<b>A</b>: Pre-built binaries of OVMF will be available under the downloads area 
	of the EDK II project. The README file included in the download will explain 
	how to run the OVMF platform.
</p>
<p class="q-and-a">
	(Please note that there may be a small delay between the initial announcement 
	of the OVMF project, and the availability of the first pre-built binaries.)
</p>
<p class="q-and-a">
	<b>Q: Where is the source code to OVMF?</b>
</p>
<p class="q-and-a">
	<b>A</b>: The source code to OVMF is under the OvmfPkg directory within the EDK 
	II source repository.
</p>
<p class="q-and-a">
	Changes to other EDK II packages (directories) will be driven by the OVMF 
	project as required.
</p>
<p class="q-and-a">
	<b>Q: Where can I find the current status and roadmap of OVMF?</b>
</p>
<p class="q-and-a">
	<b>A</b>: Please look in the 'README' file under the OvmfPkg source directory.
</p>
<p class="q-and-a">
	<b>Q: What build environments are supported by OVMF?</b>
</p>
<p class="q-and-a">
	<b>A</b>: OVMF's goal is to support all the build environments which the main 
	EDK II project supports.
</p>
<p class="q-and-a">
	This includes support for building under the Linux, Mac OS X and Windows 
	operating systems. Toolchain support includes GCC, Visual Studio (2003 or 
	2005), WINDDK, ICC (Intel Compiler) and GCC under CYGWIN.
</p>
<p class="q-and-a">
	If you are new to UEFI development, this <a href="step-by-step-instructions.html">document</a>
	may help you get a build environment up and running.
</p>
<p class="q-and-a">
	OVMF will also require an ASL compiler to be installed on the system. The Intel 
	ASL compiler is compatible with many operating systems, and is available from <a href="http://www.acpica.org">
		http://www.acpica.org</a>.
</p>
<p class="q-and-a">
	<b>Q: Where can I ask additional questions and discuss OVMF?</b>
</p>
<p class="q-and-a">
	<b>A</b>: Questions and discussion related to OVMF should be directed to the <a href="https://edk2.tianocore.org">
		EDK II</a> dev email list.
</p>
<p class="q-and-a">
	<b>Q: How can I contribute to OVMF?</b>
</p>
<p class="q-and-a">
	<b>A</b>: Please refer to <a href="https://www.tianocore.org/ContributorsGettingStarted.html">
