Routine Description:
  
  Hook point after a boot attempt succeeds. We don't expect a boot option to
  return, so the EFI 1.0 specification defines that you will default to an
  interactive mode and stop processing the BootOrder list in this case. This
  is alos a platform implementation and can be customized by IBV/OEM.

Arguments:

  Option - Pointer to Boot Option that succeeded to boot.

Returns:
  
  None.
