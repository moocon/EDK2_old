/**
  Support routine for the PE/COFF Loader that reads a buffer from a PE/COFF file

  @param  FileHandle   The handle to the PE/COFF file 
  @param  FileOffset   The offset, in bytes, into the file to read 
  @param  ReadSize     The number of bytes to read from the file starting at 
                       FileOffset 
  @param  Buffer       A pointer to the buffer to read the data into. 

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS  ReadSize bytes of data were read into Buffer from the 
                       PE/COFF file starting at FileOffset
