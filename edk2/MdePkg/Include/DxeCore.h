/** @file

  Root include file for DXE Core

  The DXE Core has its own module type since its entry point definition is 
  unique. This module type should only be used by the DXE core. The build 
  infrastructure must set EFI_SPECIFICATION_VERSION  before including  this 
  file. To support EDK II/UEFI2.0 set EFI_SPECIFIATION_VERSION to 0x00020000. To 
  support EDK/EFI 1.10 set EFI_SPECIFIATION_VERSION to 0x00010010. 
  EDK_RELEASE_VERSION must be set to a non zero value.   
  EFI_SPECIFIATION_VERSION and EDK_RELEASE_VERSION are set automatically
  by the build infrastructure for every module.
