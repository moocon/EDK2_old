<h2 class="western"><font size="2">The EDK II Project </font></h2>
<p class="western">
<font size="2">The EDK II project is the response to the EFI community&rsquo;s request for a better build and version tracking environment for the EDK. The main differentiation of the EDK II to the current product EDK is the <strong>Enhanced Build Environment </strong>of the EDK II. </font>
</p>

<p class="western">
<font size="2">The advantages of the Enhanced Build Environment include:</font> 
</p>
<ul><li>
<p class="western" style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0in">
<font size="2">XML based build definition tools</font> 
</p>
</li><li>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">
<font size="2">Operating System independence</font> 
</p>
</li><li>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">
<font size="2">Flexibility in choosing the compiler and assembler tools</font> 
</p>
</li><li>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">
<font size="2">The ability to generate working code using open source build tools and applications</font> 
</p>
</li><li>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">
<font size="2">Enhanced development and build capability specific modules and specific module packages </font>
</p>
</li><li>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">
<font size="2">Use of configuration tools and data sets to provide standard build mechanics with flexibility</font> 
</p>
</li><li>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.19in">
<font size="2">Addition of online source control, will allow you to contribute to the code base and become an active contributor to the EFI open source community</font> 
</p>
</li></ul>
<p class="western" style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
<font size="2">The EDK II enhanced build environment is a significant departure from the build environment of the current EDK. There are many new concepts and features in the EDK II, which have altered the environment radically. If you are familiar with the current EDK these changes will be obvious, while the benefits of them will be apparent to everyone. </font>
</p>

<p class="western" style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
<font size="2">It is important to note, that the compiled results of the EDK II are equivalent to our current EDK, the changes are in the build environment and only affect the sources at the build environment level. In other words, any differences in the code files of the EDK II from the current EDK are only to support the changes in the build environment, once the modules are created, they are functionally identical. </font>
</p>

<p class="western" style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
<font size="2">In point of fact, the EDK II is classified at a development level project and the current EDK is an official level project. The current EDK is still intended to be used for volume production and shipments while the EDK II is being further refined through additional development (a process of a year, possibly two).</font> 
</p>

<p class="western" style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
<font size="2">As the EDK II project matures and the active participation of the EFI open source community members expand the project&rsquo;s scope (features, functionality, and support) the EDK II project will grow into an official level project. In the mean time, we are pleased in your interest in the EDK II project and encourage your participation and feedback.</font>

<h2 class="western"><font size="2">Notes on FAT II Driver Project</font></h2>
<p class="western" style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
<font size="2">FAT Driver Projects are projects for the FAT32 File System Driver, which is based on Microsoft's FAT32 File System Driver Specification. The Fat Drivers are separate from the EDK projects only because the terms of use of the code are unique, requiring us to keep them in a separate code repository (the terms are basically that code developed using the FAT32 Specification must be associated with EFI). </font>
</p>

<p class="western" style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
<font size="2">Since the EDK II involved making changes to the source files to support the enhanced build environment, FAT file system driver sources required changes to be compatible with the EDK II build environment. The FAT II sub-project provides those compatible sources without impacting the original FAT driver sub project of the current EDK. </font>
</p>

<p class="western" style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
<font size="2">The FAT II Driver Project is a subproject of the EDK II project, and is only used to house the FAT32 code repository. All development tools in the EDK II project are integrated with this sub-project. This project is to be used only to update the repository or to get access to the latest code snapshots. Use the EDK II project to post issues, join mailing lists, participate in discussion forums, etc. In short, consider them one project with two code repositories.</font>
