/** The strtol, strtoll, strtoul, and strtoull functions convert the initial
    portion of the string pointed to by nptr to long int, long long int,
    unsigned long int, and unsigned long long int representation, respectively.
    First, they decompose the input string into three parts: an initial,
    possibly empty, sequence of white-space characters (as specified by the
    isspace function), a subject sequence resembling an integer represented in
    some radix determined by the value of base, and a final string of one or
    more unrecognized characters, including the terminating null character of
    the input string. Then, they attempt to convert the subject sequence to an
    integer, and return the result.

    If the value of base is zero, the expected form of the subject sequence is
    that of an integer constant as described in 6.4.4.1, optionally preceded
    by a plus or minus sign, but not including an integer suffix. If the value
    of base is between 2 and 36 (inclusive), the expected form of the subject
    sequence is a sequence of letters and digits representing an integer with
    the radix specified by base, optionally preceded by a plus or minus sign,
    but not including an integer suffix. The letters from a (or A) through z
    (or Z) are ascribed the values 10 through 35; only letters and digits whose
    ascribed values are less than that of base are permitted. If the value of
    base is 16, the characters 0x or 0X may optionally precede the sequence of
    letters and digits, following the sign if present.

    The subject sequence is defined as the longest initial subsequence of the
    input string, starting with the first non-white-space character, that is of
    the expected form. The subject sequence contains no characters if the input
    string is empty or consists entirely of white space, or if the first
    non-white-space character is other than a sign or a permissible letter or digit.

    If the subject sequence has the expected form and the value of base is
    zero, the sequence of characters starting with the first digit is
    interpreted as an integer constant. If the subject sequence has the
    expected form and the value of base is between 2 and 36, it is used as the
    base for conversion, ascribing to each letter its value as given above. If
    the subject sequence begins with a minus sign, the value resulting from the
    conversion is negated (in the return type). A pointer to the final string
    is stored in the object pointed to by endptr, provided that endptr is
    not a null pointer.

    In other than the "C" locale, additional locale-specific subject sequence
    forms may be accepted.

    If the subject sequence is empty or does not have the expected form, no
    conversion is performed; the value of nptr is stored in the object pointed
    to by endptr, provided that endptr is not a null pointer.

  @return   The strtol, strtoll, strtoul, and strtoull functions return the

/** Convert a wide-character string into a multibyte character string.

    The wcstombs function converts a sequence of wide characters from the
    array pointed to by src into a sequence of corresponding multibyte
    characters that begins in the initial shift state, and stores these
    multibyte characters into the array pointed to by dest, stopping if a
    multibyte character would exceed the limit of limit total bytes or if a
    null character is stored. Each wide character is converted as if by
    a call to the wctomb function, except that the conversion state of
    the wctomb function is not affected.

    No more than limit bytes will be modified in the array pointed to by dest.
    If copying takes place between objects that overlap,
    the behavior is undefined.

  @return   If a wide character is encountered that does not correspond to a
            valid multibyte character, the wcstombs function returns
            (size_t)(-1). Otherwise, the wcstombs function returns the number
            of bytes modified, not including a terminating null character,
            if any.
