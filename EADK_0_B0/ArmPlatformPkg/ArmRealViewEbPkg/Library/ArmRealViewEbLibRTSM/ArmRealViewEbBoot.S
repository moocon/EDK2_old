/**
  Initialize the memory where the initial stacks will reside

  This memory can contain the initial stacks (Secure and Secure Monitor stacks).
  In some platform, this region is already initialized and the implementation of this function can
  do nothing. This memory can also represent the Secure RAM.
  This function is called before the satck has been set up. Its implementation must ensure the stack
  pointer is not used (probably required to use assembly language)
