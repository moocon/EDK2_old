  Allocates one or more 4KB pages of a certain memory type.

  Allocates the number of 4KB pages of a certain memory type and returns a pointer to the allocated
  buffer.  The buffer returned is aligned on a 4KB boundary.  If Pages is 0, then NULL is returned.
  If there is not enough memory remaining to satisfy the request, then NULL is returned.
