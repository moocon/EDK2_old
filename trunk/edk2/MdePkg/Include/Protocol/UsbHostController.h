  EFI_USB_HC_PROTOCOL as defined in EFI 1.10.

  The USB Host Controller Protocol is used by code, typically USB bus drivers, 
  running in the EFI boot services environment, to perform data transactions 
  over a USB bus. In addition, it provides an abstraction for the root hub of the USB bus.

/**  
  @par Protocol Description:
  The EFI_USB_HC_PROTOCOL provides USB host controller management, basic data transactions
  over a USB bus, and USB root hub access. A device driver that wishes to manage a USB bus in a
  system retrieves the EFI_USB_HC_PROTOCOL instance that is associated with the USB bus to be
  managed. A device handle for a USB host controller will minimally contain an
  EFI_DEVICE_PATH_PROTOCOL instance, and an EFI_USB_HC_PROTOCOL instance. 
  
  @param Reset 
  Software reset of USB. 

  @param GetState 
  Retrieves the current state of the USB host controller. 

  @param SetState 
  Sets the USB host controller to a specific state. 

  @param ControlTransfer 
  Submits a control transfer to a target USB device. 

  @param BulkTransfer 
  Submits a bulk transfer to a bulk endpoint of a USB device. 

  @param AsyncInterruptTransfer
  Submits an asynchronous interrupt transfer to an interrupt endpoint
  of a USB device. 

  @param SyncInterruptTransfer
  Submits a synchronous interrupt transfer to an interrupt endpoint
  of a USB device.

  @param IsochronousTransfer 
  Submits isochronous transfer to an isochronous endpoint of a USB device.

  @param AsyncIsochronousTransfer
  Submits nonblocking USB isochronous transfer.

  @param GetRootHubPortNumber 
  Retrieves the number of root hub ports that are produced by the
  USB host controller. 

  @param GetRootHubPortStatus 
  Retrieves the status of the specified root hub port. 

  @param SetRootHubPortFeature
  Sets the feature for the specified root hub port.

  @param ClearRootHubPortFeature
  Clears the feature for the specified root hub port. 

  @param MajorRevision 
  The major revision number of the USB host controller. The
  revision information indicates the release of the Universal Serial
  Bus Specification with which the host controller is compliant.

  @param MinorRevision 
  The minor revision number of the USB host controller. The
  revision information indicates the release of the Universal Serial
  Bus Specification with which the host controller is compliant.
