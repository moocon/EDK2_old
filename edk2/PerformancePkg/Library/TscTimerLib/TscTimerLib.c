/** @file
  A Timer Library implementation which uses the Time Stamp Counter in the processor.

  For Pentium 4 processors, Intel Xeon processors (family [0FH], models [03H and higher]);
    for Intel Core Solo and Intel Core Duo processors (family [06H], model [0EH]);
    for the Intel Xeon processor 5100 series and Intel Core 2 Duo processors (family [06H], model [0FH]);
    for Intel Core 2 and Intel Xeon processors (family [06H], display_model [17H]);
    for Intel Atom processors (family [06H], display_model [1CH]):
  the time-stamp counter increments at a constant rate.
  That rate may be set by the maximum core-clock to bus-clock ratio of the processor or may be set by
  the maximum resolved frequency at which the processor is booted. The maximum resolved frequency may
  differ from the maximum qualified frequency of the processor.

  The specific processor configuration determines the behavior. Constant TSC behavior ensures that the
  duration of each clock tick is uniform and supports the use of the TSC as a wall clock timer even if
  the processor core changes frequency.  This is the architectural behavior moving forward.

  A Processor's support for invariant TSC is indicated by CPUID.0x80000007.EDX[8].

/** The constructor function determines the actual TSC frequency.

  The TSC counting frequency is determined by comparing how far it counts
  during a 1ms period as determined by the ACPI timer.  The ACPI timer is
  used because it counts at a known frequency.
  If ACPI I/O space not enabled, this function will enable it.  Then the
  TSC is sampled, followed by waiting for 3579 clocks of the ACPI timer, or 1ms.
  The TSC is then sampled again. The difference multiplied by 1000 is the TSC
  frequency.  There will be a small error because of the overhead of reading
  the ACPI timer.  An attempt is made to determine and compensate for this error.
  This function will always return RETURN_SUCCESS.

  @retval RETURN_SUCCESS   The constructor always returns RETURN_SUCCESS.

  The time-stamp counter (as implemented in the P6 family, Pentium, Pentium M,
  Pentium 4, Intel Xeon, Intel Core Solo and Intel Core Duo processors and
  later processors) is a 64-bit counter that is set to 0 following a RESET of
  the processor.  Following a RESET, the counter increments even when the
  processor is halted by the HLT instruction or the external STPCLK# pin. Note
  that the assertion of the external DPSLP# pin may cause the time-stamp
  counter to stop.

  The properties of the counter can be retrieved by the
  GetPerformanceCounterProperties() function.
