/**
   
  This function is the primary interface to the internal
  forms-based browser. By calling this routine, one is directing
  the browser to use a variety of passed-in information or
  primarily use the HII database as the source of information.

  @param This   A pointer to the EFI_FORM_BROWSER2_PROTOCOL
                instance.

  @param Handle   A pointer to an array of HII handles to
                  display. This value should correspond to the
                  value of the HII form package that is required
                  to be displayed.

  @param HandleCount  The number of handles in the array
                      specified by Handle.

  @param SingleUse  If FALSE, the browser operates as a standard
                    forms processor and exits only when
                    explicitly requested by the user. If TRUE,
                    the browser will return immediately after
                    processing the first user-generated
                    selection.

  @param ScreenDimensions   Allows the browser to be called so
                            that it occupies a portion of the
                            physical screen instead of
                            dynamically determining the screen
                            dimensions. If the input values
                            violate the platform policy then the
                            dimensions will be dynamically
                            adjusted to comply.

  @param ResetRequired  This BOOLEAN value will tell the caller
                        if a reset is required based on the data
                        that might have been changed. The
                        ResetRequired parameter is primarily
                        applicable for configuration
                        applications, and is an optional
                        parameter.

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS   The function completed successfully
  
  @retval EFI_NOT_FOUND   The variable was not found.
  
  @retval EFI_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL  The DataSize is too small for
                                the result. DataSize has been
                                updated with the size needed to
                                complete the request.
  
  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER   One of the parameters has an
                                  invalid value.
  
  @retval EFI_DEVICE_ERROR  The variable could not be saved due
                            to a hardware failure.

  This routine is called by a routine which was called by the

/**
   
  This protocol is the interface to call for drivers to leverage
  the EFI configuration driver interface.

  @param SendForm   Provides direction to the configuration
                    driver whether to use the HII database or to
                    use a passed-in set of data. This functions
                    also establishes a pointer to the calling
                    driver's callback interface. See the
                    SendForm() function description.

  @param BrowserCallback  Routine used to expose internal
                          configuration state of the browser.
                          This is primarily used by callback
                          handler routines which were called by
                          the browser and in-turn need to get
