  Return the pointer to the first instruction of a function given a function pointer.
  On EBC architectures, these two pointer values are the same, 
  so the implementation of this macro is very simple.
  
  @param  p A pointer to a function

  @return The pointer to the first instruction of a function given a function pointer.
