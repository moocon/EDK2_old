MISC_SUBCLASS_TABLE_FUNCTION (
  MiscSystemManufacturer
  )
/*++
Description:

  This function makes boot time changes to the contents of the
  MiscSystemManufacturer (Type 13).

Parameters:

  RecordType
    Type of record to be processed from the Data Table.
    mMiscSubclassDataTable[].RecordType

  RecordLen
    Size of static RecordData from the Data Table.
    mMiscSubclassDataTable[].RecordLen

  RecordData
    Pointer to copy of RecordData from the Data Table.  Changes made
    to this copy will be written to the Data Hub but will not alter
    the contents of the static Data Table.

  LogRecordData
    Set *LogRecordData to TRUE to log RecordData to Data Hub.
    Set *LogRecordData to FALSE when there is no more data to log.

Returns:

  EFI_SUCCESS
    All parameters were valid and *RecordData and *LogRecordData have
    been set.

  EFI_UNSUPPORTED
    Unexpected RecordType value.

  EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER
    One of the following parameter conditions was true:
      RecordLen was zero.
      RecordData was NULL.
      LogRecordData was NULL.
