  UEFI Runtime Library implementation for non IPF processor types.

  This library hides the global variable for the EFI Runtime Services so the
  caller does not need to deal with the possiblitly of being called from an
  OS virtual address space. All pointer values are different for a virtual 
  mapping than from the normal physical mapping at boot services time.

/**
  Resets the entire platform.

  @param  ResetType   The type of reset to perform.
  @param  ResetStatus The status code for the reset. If the system reset is part of a
                      normal operation, the status code would be EFI_SUCCESS. If the system
                      reset is due to some type of failure the most appropriate EFI Status
                      code would be used.
  @param  DataSizeThe size, in bytes, of ResetData.
  @param  ResetData   For a ResetType of EfiResetCold, EfiResetWarm, or EfiResetShutdown
                      the data buffer starts with a Null-terminated Unicode string, optionally
                      followed by additional binary data. The string is a description that the
                      caller may use to further indicate the reason for the system reset. ResetData
                      is only valid if ResetStatus is something other then EFI_SUCCESS. This
                      pointer must be a physical address. For a ResetType of EfiRestUpdate the
                      data buffer also starts with a Null-terminated string that is followed by
                      a physical VOID * to an EFI_CAPSULE_HEADER.

/**
  This service is a wrapper for the UEFI Runtime Service GetTime().

  The GetTime() function returns a time that was valid sometime during the call to the function.
  While the returned EFI_TIME structure contains TimeZone and Daylight savings time information,
  the actual clock does not maintain these values. The current time zone and daylight saving time
  information returned by GetTime() are the values that were last set via SetTime().
  The GetTime() function should take approximately the same amount of time to read the time each
  time it is called. All reported device capabilities are to be rounded up.
  During runtime, if a PC-AT CMOS device is present in the platform the caller must synchronize
  access to the device before calling GetTime().

  @param  Time         A pointer to storage to receive a snapshot of the current time.

  This service is a wrapper for the UEFI Runtime Service SetTime().

  The SetTime() function sets the real time clock device to the supplied time, and records the
  current time zone and daylight savings time information. The SetTime() function is not allowed
  to loop based on the current time. For example, if the device does not support a hardware reset
  for the sub-resolution time, the code is not to implement the feature by waiting for the time to
  wrap.
  During runtime, if a PC-AT CMOS device is present in the platform the caller must synchronize
  access to the device before calling SetTime().

  @param  Time  A pointer to the current time. Type EFI_TIME is defined in the GetTime()

  Determines the new virtual address that is to be used on subsequent memory accesses.

  For IA32, X64, and EBC, this service is a wrapper for the UEFI Runtime Service

  For IPF, this function interprets Address as a pointer to an EFI_PLABEL structure
  and both the EntryPoint and GP fields of an EFI_PLABEL are converted from physical
  to virtiual addressing.  Since IPF allows the GP to point to an address outside
  a PE/COFF image, the physical to virtual offset for the EntryPoint field is used
  to adjust the GP field.  The UEFI Runtime Service ConvertPointer() is used to convert
  EntryPoint and the status code for this conversion is always returned.   If the convertion

/**
  The QueryCapsuleCapabilities() function allows a caller to test to see if a capsule or
  capsules can be updated via UpdateCapsule(). The Flags values in the capsule header and
  size of the entire capsule is checked.
  If the caller needs to query for generic capsule capability a fake EFI_CAPSULE_HEADER can be
  constructed where CapsuleImageSize is equal to HeaderSize that is equal to sizeof
  (EFI_CAPSULE_HEADER). To determine reset requirements,
  CAPSULE_FLAGS_PERSIST_ACROSS_RESET should be set in the Flags field of the
  EFI_CAPSULE_HEADER.
  The firmware must support any capsule that has the
  CAPSULE_FLAGS_PERSIST_ACROSS_RESET flag set in EFI_CAPSULE_HEADER. The
  firmware sets the policy for what capsules are supported that do not have the
  CAPSULE_FLAGS_PERSIST_ACROSS_RESET flag set.

  @param  CapsuleHeaderArray    Virtual pointer to an array of virtual pointers to the capsules
                                being passed into update capsule. The capsules are assumed to
                                stored in contiguous virtual memory.
  @param  CapsuleCount          Number of pointers to EFI_CAPSULE_HEADER in
                                CaspuleHeaderArray.
  @param  MaximumCapsuleSize    On output the maximum size that UpdateCapsule() can
                                support as an argument to UpdateCapsule() via
                                CapsuleHeaderArray and ScatterGatherList.

  @param  ResetType             Returns the type of reset required for the capsule update.

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS           Valid answer returned..
  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER MaximumCapsuleSize is NULL.
  @retval EFI_UNSUPPORTED       The capsule type is not supported on this platform, and

  Returns information about the EFI variables.

  The QueryVariableInfo() function allows a caller to obtain the information about the

  space available for the EFI variables and the maximum size of each individual EFI variable,
  associated with the attributes specified.

  attributes are not additive in nature.
