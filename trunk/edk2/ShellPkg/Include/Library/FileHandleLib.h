/**
  This function reads information from an opened file.

  If FileHandle is not a directory, the function reads the requested number of 
  bytes from the file at the file's current position and returns them in Buffer. 
  If the read goes beyond the end of the file, the read length is truncated to the
  end of the file. The file's current position is increased by the number of bytes 
  returned.  If FileHandle is a directory, the function reads the directory entry 
  at the file's current position and returns the entry in Buffer. If the Buffer 
  is not large enough to hold the current directory entry, then 
  EFI_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL is returned and the current file position is not updated. 
  BufferSize is set to be the size of the buffer needed to read the entry. On 
  success, the current position is updated to the next directory entry. If there 
  are no more directory entries, the read returns a zero-length buffer. 
  EFI_FILE_INFO is the structure returned as the directory entry.
