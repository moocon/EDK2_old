  This return the handle number for the calling processor.  This service may be
  called from the BSP and APs.

  This service returns the processor handle number for the calling processor.
  The returned value is in the range from 0 to the total number of logical
  processors minus 1. The total number of logical processors can be retrieved
  with EFI_PEI_MP_SERVICES_PPI.GetNumberOfProcessors(). This service may be
  called from the BSP and APs. If ProcessorNumber is NULL, then EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER
  is returned. Otherwise, the current processors handle number is returned in
  ProcessorNumber, and EFI_SUCCESS is returned.

  @param[in]  PeiServices         An indirect pointer to the PEI Services Table
                                  published by the PEI Foundation.
  @param[in]  This                A pointer to the EFI_PEI_MP_SERVICES_PPI instance.
  @param[out] ProcessorNumber     The handle number of the AP. The range is from 0 to the
                                  total number of logical processors minus 1. The total
                                  number of logical processors can be retrieved by
                                  EFI_PEI_MP_SERVICES_PPI.GetNumberOfProcessors().

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS             The current processor handle number was returned in
                                  ProcessorNumber.
  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER   ProcessorNumber is NULL.
