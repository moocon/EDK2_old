/**
  Applies additional actions to relocate fixups to a PE/COFF image.

  Generally this function is called after sucessfully Applying relocation fixups 
  to a PE/COFF image for some specicial purpose. 
  As a example, For NT32 emulator, the function should be implemented and called
  to support source level debug.  
  
  @param  ImageContext        Pointer to the image context structure that describes the PE/COFF
                              image that is being relocated.

/**
  Unloads a loaded PE/COFF image from memory and releases its taken resource.
  
  Releases any environment specific resources that were allocated when the image 
  specified by ImageContext was loaded using PeCoffLoaderLoadImage(). 
  For NT32 emulator, the PE/COFF image loaded by system needs to release.
  For real platform, the PE/COFF image loaded by Core doesn't needs to be unloaded, 
  
  If ImageContext is NULL, then ASSERT().

                                    image to be unloaded.
