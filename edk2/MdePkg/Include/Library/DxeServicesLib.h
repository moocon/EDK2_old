/**
  Searches all the availables firmware volumes and returns the first matching FFS section. 

  This function searches all the firmware volumes for FFS files with an FFS filename specified by NameGuid.  
  The order that the firmware volumes is searched is not deterministic. For each FFS file found a search 
  is made for FFS sections of type SectionType. If the FFS file contains at least SectionInstance instances 
  of the FFS section specified by SectionType, then the SectionInstance instance is returned in Buffer. 
  Buffer is allocated using AllocatePool(), and the size of the allocated buffer is returned in Size. 
  It is the caller's responsibility to use FreePool() to free the allocated buffer.  
  See EFI_FIRMWARE_VOLUME2_PROTOCOL.ReadSection() for details on how sections 
  are retrieved from an FFS file based on SectionType and SectionInstance.

  If SectionType is EFI_SECTION_TE, and the search with an FFS file fails, 
  the search will be retried with a section type of EFI_SECTION_PE32.
  This function must be called with a TPL <= TPL_NOTIFY.

  If Buffer is NULL, then ASSERT().
  If Size is NULL, then ASSERT().

                               any of the firmware volumes in the platform. 
  @param  SectionType          Indicates the FFS section type to search for within the FFS file specified by NameGuid.
  @param  SectionInstance      Indicates which section instance within the FFS file specified by NameGuid to retrieve.
  @param  Buffer               On output, a pointer to a callee allocated buffer containing the FFS file section that was found.
