/**
  Retrieves a Unicode string that is the user readable name of the controller

  This function retrieves the user readable name of the controller specified by
  ControllerHandle and ChildHandle in the form of a Unicode string. If the
  driver specified by This has a user readable name in the language specified by
  Language, then a pointer to the controller name is returned in ControllerName,

  support the language specified by Language, then EFI_UNSUPPORTED is returned.
