<p><font size="2"><b>The EDK II Project </b></font>
</p>
<p><font size="2">The EDK II project is the response to the EFI community’s request for 
		a better build and version tracking environment for UEFI and PI development. 
		The main difference between the EDK II to the original EDK is the <b>Enhanced Build 
			Environment </b>of the EDK II.
		<br>
		The advantages of the Enhanced Build Environment include: </font>
</p>
<p><font size="2">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		XML based build definition tools
		<br>
		•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		Operating System independence
		<br>
		•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		Flexibility in choosing the compiler and assembler tools
		<br>
		•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		The ability to generate working code using open source build tools and 
		applications
		<br>
		•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		Enhanced development and build capability of modules and module packages
		<br>
		•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		Use of build configuration tools and data sets to provide flexible process<br>
		•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		Online source control allows users to contribute code and become participants\</font></p>
<p><font size="2">The EDK II enhanced build environment is a significant departure from 
		the build environment of the original EDK. There are many new concepts and 
		features in the EDK II, which have altered the environment radically. If you 
		are familiar with the original EDK these changes will be obvious, while the 
		benefits of them will be apparent to everyone. </font>
</p>
<p><font size="2">It is important to note, that the compiled results of the EDK 
		II&nbsp;are equivalent to the original EDK, the changes are in the build 
		environment and only affect the sources at that level. In other words, any 
		differences in the code files are only to support the changes in the build 
		environment, once the modules are created, they are functionally identical. </font>
</p>
<p><font size="2">In point of fact, the EDK II is classified at a development level 
		project and the EDK is an official level project. The EDK is still intended to 
		be used for volume production and shipments while the EDK II is being further 
		refined through additional development.
		<br>
		As the EDK II project matures and the active participation of the EFI open 
		source community members expand the project’s scope (features, functionality, 
		and support) the EDK II project will grow into an official level project. In 
		the mean time, we are pleased in your interest in the EDK II project and 
		encourage your participation and feedback. </font>

<p><font size="2"><b>Notes on FAT II Driver Project</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2">FAT Driver Projects are projects for the FAT32 File System Driver, 
		which is based on Microsoft's FAT32 File System Driver Specification. The Fat 
		Drivers are separate from the EDK projects only because the terms of use of the 
		code are unique, requiring us to keep them in a separate code repository (the 
		terms are basically that code developed using the FAT32 Specification must be 
		associated with EFI). </font>
</p>
<p><font size="2">Since the EDK II involved making changes to the source files to 
		support the enhanced build environment, FAT file system driver sources required 
		changes to be compatible with the EDK II build environment. The FAT II 
		sub-project provides those compatible sources without impacting the original 
		FAT driver sub project of the current EDK. </font>
</p>
<p><font size="2">The FAT II Driver Project is a subproject of the EDK II project, and 
		is only used to house the FAT32 code repository. All development tools in the 
		EDK II project are integrated with this sub-project. This project is to be used 
		only to update the repository or to get access to the latest code snapshots. 
		Use the EDK II project to post issues, join mailing lists, participate in 
		discussion forums, etc. In short, consider them one project with two code 
		repositories. </font>
