Module name:
 callback.c

Abstract:
 This file contains two sets of callback routines for undi3.0 and undi3.1.
 the callback routines for Undi3.1 have an extra parameter UniqueId which
 stores the interface context for the NIC that snp is trying to talk..

Routine Description:
 This is a callback routine supplied to UNDI at undi_start time.
 UNDI call this routine with a virtual or CPU address that SNP provided
 to convert it to a physical or device address. Since EFI uses the identical
 mapping, this routine returns the physical address same as the virtual address
 for most of the addresses. an address above 4GB cannot generally be used as a
 device address, it needs to be mapped to a lower physical address. This routine
 does not call the map routine itself, but it assumes that the mapping was done
 at the time of providing the address to UNDI. This routine just looks up the
 address in a map table (which is the v2p structure chain)

Arguments:
 CpuAddr - virtual address of a buffer
 DeviceAddrPtr - pointer to the physical address

Returns:
 void - The DeviceAddrPtr will contain 0 in case of any error

Routine Description:
 This is a callback routine supplied to UNDI at undi_start time.
 This is the IO routine for UNDI. This is not currently being used by UNDI3.0
 because Undi3.0 uses io/mem offsets relative to the beginning of the device
 io/mem address and so it needs to use the PCI_IO_FUNCTION that abstracts the
 start of the device's io/mem addresses. Since SNP cannot retrive the context
 of the undi3.0 interface it cannot use the PCI_IO_FUNCTION that specific for
 that NIC and uses one global IO functions structure, this does not work.
 This however works fine for EFI1.0 Undis because they use absolute addresses
 for io/mem access.

Arguments:
  ReadOrWrite - indicates read or write, IO or Memory
  NumBytes    - number of bytes to read or write
  Address     - IO or memory address to read from or write to
  BufferAddr  - memory location to read into or that contains the bytes
                to write
