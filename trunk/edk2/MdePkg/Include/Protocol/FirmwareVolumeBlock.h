  EFI_ACCESS_DENIED without modifying the contents of the

  boundaries. If a read is requested that would span a block
  boundary, the read must read up to the boundary but not
  beyond. The output parameter NumBytes must be set to correctly
  indicate the number of bytes actually read. The caller must be

/**
  The Write() function writes the specified number of bytes from
  the provided buffer to the specified block and offset. If the
  firmware volume is sticky write, the caller must ensure that
  all the bits of the specified range to write are in the
  EFI_FVB_ERASE_POLARITY state before calling the Write()
  function, or else the result will be unpredictable. This
  unpredictability arises because, for a sticky-write firmware
  volume, a write may negate a bit in the EFI_FVB_ERASE_POLARITY
  state but it cannot flip it back again. In general, before
  calling the Write() function, the caller should call the
  EraseBlocks() function first to erase the specified block to
  write. A block erase cycle will transition bits from the
  (NOT)EFI_FVB_ERASE_POLARITY state back to the
  EFI_FVB_ERASE_POLARITY state. Implementations should be
  mindful that the firmware volume might be in the WriteDisabled
  state. If it is in this state, the Write() function must
  return the status code EFI_ACCESS_DENIED without modifying the
  contents of the firmware volume. The Write() function must
  also prevent spanning block boundaries. If a write is
  requested that spans a block boundary, the write must store up
  to the boundary but not beyond. The output parameter NumBytes
  must be set to correctly indicate the number of bytes actually
  written. The caller must be aware that a write may be
  partially completed. All writes, partial or otherwise, must be
  fully flushed to the hardware before the Write() service
  returns.

/**
  The EraseBlocks() function erases one or more blocks as denoted
  by the variable argument list. The entire parameter list of
  blocks must be verified before erasing any blocks. If a block is
  requested that does not exist within the associated firmware
  volume (it has a larger index than the last block of the
  firmware volume), the EraseBlocks() function must return the
  status code EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER without modifying the contents
  of the firmware volume. Implementations should be mindful that
  the firmware volume might be in the WriteDisabled state. If it
  is in this state, the EraseBlocks() function must return the
  status code EFI_ACCESS_DENIED without modifying the contents of
  the firmware volume. All calls to EraseBlocks() must be fully
  flushed to the hardware before the EraseBlocks() service
  returns.

  @param This   Indicates the EFI_FIRMWARE_VOLUME_BLOCK_PROTOCOL
                instance.

  @param ...    The variable argument list is a list of tuples.
                Each tuple describes a range of LBAs to erase
                and consists of the following:
                - An EFI_LBA that indicates the starting LBA
                - A UINTN that indicates the number of blocks to
                  erase

                The list is terminated with an
                EFI_LBA_LIST_TERMINATOR. For example, the
                following indicates that two ranges of blocks
                (5-7 and 10-11) are to be erased: EraseBlocks
                (This, 5, 3, 10, 2, EFI_LBA_LIST_TERMINATOR);

/**
  The Firmware Volume Block Protocol is the low-level interface
  to a firmware volume. File-level access to a firmware volume
  should not be done using the Firmware Volume Block Protocol.
  Normal access to a firmware volume must use the Firmware
  Volume Protocol. Typically, only the file system driver that
  produces the Firmware Volume Protocol will bind to the
  Firmware Volume Block Protocol. The Firmware Volume Block
  Protocol provides the following:
  - Byte-level read/write functionality.
  - Block-level erase functionality.
  - It further exposes device-hardening features, such as may be
    equired to protect the firmware from unwanted overwriting
    and/or erasure.
  - It is useful to layer a file system driver on top of the
    Firmware Volume Block Protocol.

  This file system driver produces the Firmware Volume Protocol,
  which provides file-level access to a firmware volume. The
  Firmware Volume Protocol abstracts the file system that is
  used to format the firmware volume and the hardware
  device-hardening features that may be present.
