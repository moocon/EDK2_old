  Step-by-step (walk-throughs) for building with edk2
</h2>

<p class="main-details">
  <font size="2">
    This page contains some step-by-step guides in an attempt to give
    a highly detailed description of how to set up building on an edk2
    system.&nbsp;
    A few different operating systems are targeted.&nbsp;
    It is hoped that these examples can either provide exact steps for
    setting up an edk2 build environment.&nbsp;
    If instructions are not available for your exact system configuration,
    you may still be able to 'tweak' the instructions to work on your
    system.

  These instructions for Ubuntu 8.04 are currently under construction.&nbsp;
  Please do not try to use them until this notice is removed!
</p>

<h3 class="build-step-title">
  Getting started &amp; Instructions for the instructions
</h3>

<p class="build-step-details">
  These instructions will be written as a series of commands executed from
  a command terminal.&nbsp;
  To open the command terminal application, open the "Applications" menu,
  then open the "Accessories" sub-menu, and then select the "Terminal"
  application.
</p>

<p class="build-step-details">
  Often these instructions will contain a command which needs to be
  executed in the terminal window.&nbsp; For example:
</p>

<pre class="build-step-code">
bash:~$ <b>echo this bold text is a sample command</b>
</pre>

<p class="build-step-details">
  To execute this command, highlight the <b>bold</b> text of the 
  command in your web browser.&nbsp;
  After the text is highlighted, you can paste the text into the terminal
  window with the middle mouse button.&nbsp;
</p>
<p class="build-step-details">
  There may be other ways to copy and paste the text into the terminal.&nbsp;
  For example, you can usually press 'Ctrl-C' within your web browser to copy
  the text, and within the gnome-terminal program you can then press
  'Ctrl-<b>Shift</b>-V' to paste the text.&nbsp;
  After pasting the command into the shell, you may need to press the
  enter or return key to execute the command.&nbsp;
  If all else fails, you can type the command by hand.
</p>

<p class="build-step-details">
  Some commands are very long, and we use the backslash character (\) to
  tell the shell program that the line is not finished.&nbsp; For example:
</p>

<pre class="build-step-code">
bash:~$ <b>echo this bold text is a sample command \
          which is broken into two lines</b>
</pre>

<p class="build-step-details">
  When you copy and paste, make sure you include all lines of the command.&nbsp;
  If you are typing the command, you can remove the backslash character (\)
  and combine the lines into a single line if you prefer.
</p>

<p class="build-step-details">
  If a command starts with the 'sudo' command, then you may be prompted for
  your user password.&nbsp;
  This will be the same password as you used to login to the system.
</p>

<p class="build-step-details">
  For the purposes of this set of instructions, we will be using the following
  paths.&nbsp;
</p>

<table class="build-step-details">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <a href="https://edk2.tianocore.org">Edk2</a> source tree:
    </td>
    <td>
      <b>~/src/edk2</b>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <a href="https://buildtools.tianocore.org">Buildtools</a> source tree:
    </td>
    <td>
      <b>~/src/buildtools</b>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      gcc x64 cross-compiler installation:
    </td>
    <td>
      <b>~/programs/gcc/x64</b>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class="build-step-details">
  You will need to change the commands if you want to use different
  locations, but this is not recommended unless you are sure that you
  know what you are doing.
</p>

<h3 class="build-step-title">
    Install tools from apt
</h3>

<p class="build-step-details">
  Several ubuntu packages will be needed to fully set up an edk2 build
  environment.&nbsp;
  In order to easily install all the requirements, you need to run
  this command.
</p>

<pre class="build-step-code">
bash:~$ <b>sudo apt-get install build-essentials uuid-dev \
          python-setuptools texinfo bison flex libgmp3-dev \
          libmpfr-dev</b>
</pre>

<h3 class="build-step-title">
    Install python antlr module
</h3>

<p class="build-step-details">
  In order to install the python antlr module, we use the 'easy_install'
  command.&nbsp;
  The following command is the latest version right now, but if
  you encounter difficulties, you may want to confirm the version at
  <a href="http://www.antlr.org/download/Python">http://www.antlr.org/download/Python</a>.
</p>

<pre class="build-step-code">
bash:~$ <b>sudo easy_install \
  http://www.antlr.org/download/Python/antlr_python_runtime-3.0.1-py2.5.egg</b>
</pre>
