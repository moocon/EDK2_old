/**
  Retrieves a Unicode string that is the user readable name of the controller

Returns:

  EFI_BAD_BUFFER_SIZE   - The SCSI Request Packet was executed, 
                          but the entire DataBuffer could not be transferred.
                          The actual number of bytes transferred is returned

                          that order for additional status information.
  EFI_NOT_READY         - The SCSI Request Packet could not be sent because 
                          there are too many SCSI Command Packets already 
                          queued.The caller may retry again later.
  EFI_DEVICE_ERROR      - A device error occurred while attempting to send 
                          the SCSI Request Packet. See HostAdapterStatus, 
                          TargetStatus, SenseDataLength, and SenseData in
