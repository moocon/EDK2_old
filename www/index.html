<H2 LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western">The EDK II Project
</H2>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western">The EDK II project is the response to
the EFI community&rsquo;s request for a better build and version
tracking environment for the EDK. The main differentiation of the EDK
II to the current product EDK is the <B>Enhanced Build Environment </B>of
the EDK II.
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western">The advantages of the Enhanced Build
Environment include:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0in">
	XML based build definition tools</P>

	System independence</P>

	in choosing the compiler and assembler tools</P>
	<LI><P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The
	ability to generate working code using open source build tools and
	applications</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Enhanced
	development and build capability specific modules and specific
	module packages
	</P>
	<LI><P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Use
	of configuration tools and data sets to provide standard build
	mechanics with flexibility</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.19in">Addition of
	online source control, will allow you to contribute to the code base
	and become an active contributor to the EFI open source community</P>
</UL>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">The
EDK II enhanced build environment is a significant departure from the
build environment of the current EDK. There are many new concepts and
features in the EDK II, which have altered the environment radically.
If you are familiar with the current EDK these changes will be
obvious, while the benefits of them will be apparent to everyone.
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
It is important to note, that the compiled results of the EDK II are
equivalent to our current EDK, the changes are in the build
environment and only affect the sources at the build environment
level. In other words, any differences in the code files of the EDK
II from the current EDK are only to support the changes in the build
environment, once the modules are created, they are functionally
identical.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">In
point of fact, the EDK II is classified at a development level
project and the current EDK is an official level project. The current
EDK is still intended to be used for volume production and shipments
while the EDK II is being further refined through additional
development (a process of a year, possibly two).</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">As
the EDK II project matures and the active participation of the EFI
open source community members expand the project&rsquo;s scope
(features, functionality, and support) the EDK II project will grow
into an official level project. In the mean time, we are pleased in
your interest in the EDK II project and encourage your participation
and feedback.</P>

<H2 LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western">Notes on FAT II Driver Project</H2>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
FAT Driver Projects are projects for the FAT32 File System Driver,
which is based on Microsoft's FAT32 File System Driver Specification.
The Fat Drivers are separate from the EDK projects only because the
terms of use of the code are unique, requiring us to keep them in a
separate code repository (the terms are basically that code developed
using the FAT32 Specification must be associated with EFI).
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
Since the EDK II involved making changes to the source files to
support the enhanced build environment, FAT file system driver
sources required changes to be compatible with the EDK II build
environment. The FAT II sub-project provides those compatible sources
without impacting the original FAT driver sub project of the current
EDK.
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
The FAT II Driver Project is a subproject of the EDK II project, and
is only used to house the FAT32 code repository. All development
tools in the EDK II project are integrated with this sub-project.
This project is to be used only to update the repository or to get
access to the latest code snapshots. Use the EDK II project to post
issues, join mailing lists, participate in discussion forums, etc. In
short, consider them one project with two code repositories.</P>
