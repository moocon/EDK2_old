  Restores the CPU context that was saved with SetJump().

  Restores the CPU context from the buffer specified by JumpBuffer.
  This function never returns to the caller.
  Instead is resumes execution based on the state of JumpBuffer.

  If JumpBuffer is NULL, then ASSERT().
  If Value is 0, then ASSERT().

  @param  JumpBuffer    A pointer to CPU context buffer.
  @param  Value         The value to return when the SetJump() context is restored.
