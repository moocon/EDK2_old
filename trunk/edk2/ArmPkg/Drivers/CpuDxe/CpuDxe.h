/**
  This function registers and enables the handler specified by InterruptHandler for a processor 
  interrupt or exception type specified by InterruptType. If InterruptHandler is NULL, then the 
  handler for the processor interrupt or exception type specified by InterruptType is uninstalled. 
  The installed handler is called once for each processor interrupt or exception.

  @param  InterruptType    A pointer to the processor's current interrupt state. Set to TRUE if interrupts
                           are enabled and FALSE if interrupts are disabled.
  @param  InterruptHandler A pointer to a function of type EFI_CPU_INTERRUPT_HANDLER that is called
                           when a processor interrupt occurs. If this parameter is NULL, then the handler
                           will be uninstalled.
