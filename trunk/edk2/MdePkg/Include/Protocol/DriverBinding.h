  and it is the central component that allows drivers and controllers to be managed.

                                   an I/O abstraction to the driver.
  @param[in]  RemainingDevicePath  A pointer to the remaining portion of a device path.

  Stop this driver on ControllerHandle. 
  
  Release the control of this controller and remove the IScsi functions. The Stop()
  function is designed to be invoked from the EFI boot service DisconnectController(). 
  As a result, much of the error checking on the parameters to Stop() has been moved 
  into this common boot service. It is legal to call Stop() from other locations, 
  but the following calling restrictions must be followed or the system behavior will not be deterministic.
  1. ControllerHandle must be a valid EFI_HANDLE that was used on a previous call to this
     same driver's Start() function.
  2. The first NumberOfChildren handles of ChildHandleBuffer must all be a valid
     EFI_HANDLE. In addition, all of these handles must have been created in this driver's
     Start() function, and the Start() function must have called OpenProtocol() on
     ControllerHandle with an Attribute of EFI_OPEN_PROTOCOL_BY_CHILD_CONTROLLER.
  
  @param[in]  This              A pointer to the EFI_DRIVER_BINDING_PROTOCOL instance.
  @param[in]  ControllerHandle  A handle to the device being stopped. The handle must 
                                support a bus specific I/O protocol for the driver 
                                to use to stop the device.
  @param[in]  NumberOfChildren  The number of child device handles in ChildHandleBuffer.Not used.
  @param[in]  ChildHandleBuffer An array of child handles to be freed. May be NULL 
                                if NumberOfChildren is 0.Not used.

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS           The device was stopped.
  @retval EFI_DEVICE_ERROR      The device could not be stopped due to a device error.
