#/** @file
# This driver provides lite fault tolerant capability for write operation on flash devices.
# Its implementation depends on the full functionality FVB protocol that support read, write/erase flash access.
# It only supports write BufferSize <= PcdFlashNvStorageFtwSpareSize.
# That's the input write buffer data must fit within the spare range.
# This driver doesn't differentiate the update for boot block and other block.
