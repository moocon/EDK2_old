NOTE: Please confirm you have already installed Python on your machine.

In a command window, change to the top-level directory of the EDK II source.

First, set up your workspace
    c:\MyWork\edk2\> edksetup newbuild

Second, go to the module directory (For example, MdeModulePkg\Application\HelloWorld),
and then begin to build
    c:\MyWork\edk2\> cd MdeModulePkg\Application\HelloWorld
    c:\MyWork\edk2\> build

If you want to build the modules in other packages
(For example, MdePkg\Library\BaseLib\BaseLib.inf), please edit open the BaseTools\Conf\Target.txt firstly,

change the following line
    ACTIVE_PLATFORM       = MdeModulePkg/MdeModulePkg.dsc
to
    ACTIVE_PLATFORM       = MdePkg/MdePkg.dsc

and then go to MdePkg\Library\BaseLib directory and build
    c:\MyWork\edk2\> cd MdePkg\Library\BaseLib
    c:\MyWork\edk2\> build
