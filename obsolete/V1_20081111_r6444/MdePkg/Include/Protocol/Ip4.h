  This file defines the EFI IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4)
  Protocol interface. It is split into the following three main
  sections:
  - EFI IPv4 Service Binding Protocol
  - EFI IPv4 Variable
  - EFI IPv4 Protocol The EFI IPv4 Protocol provides basic
    network IPv4 packet I/O services, which includes support for
    a subset of the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) and
    may include support for the Internet Group Management
    Protocol (IGMP).
