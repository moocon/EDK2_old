  EFI IPSEC Protocol Definition
  The EFI_IPSEC_PROTOCOL is used to abstract the ability to deal with the individual
  packets sent and received by the host and provide packet-level security for IP datagram.

/**
  Handles IPsec packet processing for inbound and outbound IP packets. 

  The EFI_IPSEC_PROCESS process routine handles each inbound or outbound packet.
  The behavior is that it can perform one of the following actions: 
  bypass the packet, discard the packet, or protect the packet.       

  @param[in]      This             Pointer to the EFI_IPSEC_PROTOCOL instance.
  @param[in]      NicHandle        Instance of the network interface.
  @param[in]      IpVer            IPV4 or IPV6.
  @param[in, out] IpHead           Pointer to the IP Header.
  @param[in]      LastHead         The protocol of the next layer to be processed by IPsec.
  @param[in]      OptionsBuffer    Pointer to the options buffer. 
  @param[in]      OptionsLength    Length of the options buffer.
  @param[in, out] FragmentTable    Pointer to a list of fragments. 
  @param[in]      FragmentCount    Number of fragments.
  @param[in]      TrafficDirection Traffic direction.
  @param[out]     RecycleSignal    Event for recycling of resources.
 
  @retval EFI_SUCCESS              The packet was bypassed and all buffers remain the same.
  @retval EFI_SUCCESS              The packet was protected.
  @retval EFI_ACCESS_DENIED        The packet was discarded.
