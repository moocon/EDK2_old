</h3>

<p class="build-step-details">
  <b>Please note</b>: These instructions are currently under construction.
</p>

<h2 class="main-title">
  Getting started for Windows operating systems
</h2>

<p class="build-step-details">
  These instructions will be written as a series of commands executed from
  a command terminal.
</p>

<p class="build-step-details">
  Often these instructions will contain a command which needs to be
  executed in the terminal window.&nbsp; For example:
</p>

<pre class="build-step-code">
C:\> <b>echo this bold text is a sample command</b>
</pre>

<p class="build-step-details">
  To execute this command, highlight the
  <font class="monospace"><b>bold</b></font>
  text of the 
  command in your web browser.&nbsp;
  Most web browsers should be able to copy the text by selecting <i>Copy</i>
  under the <i>Edit</i> menu.&nbsp;
  Now, change back to the terminal application, and there should be a
  <i>Paste</i> operation under the <i>Edit</i> menu.&nbsp;
  After pasting the command into the shell, you may need to press the
  <i>enter</i> or <i>return</i> key to execute the command.&nbsp;
</p>
<p class="build-step-details">
  Of course, there may be other ways to copy and paste the command into
  the terminal which are specific to the windowing environment and
  applications that you are using.&nbsp;
  If all else fails, however, you can type the command by hand.
</p>

<p class="build-step-details">
  Some commands are very long, and we use the caret character (^) to
  tell the shell program that the command is not finished.&nbsp; For example:
</p>

<pre class="build-step-code">
C:\> <b>echo this bold text is a sample command ^
        which is broken into two lines</b>
</pre>

<p class="build-step-details">
  When you copy and paste, make sure you include all lines of the command
  (including the caret (^) characters).&nbsp;
  If you are typing the command, you can remove the caret character (^)
  and combine the lines into a single line if you prefer.
</p>

<p class="build-step-details">
  For the purposes of this set of instructions, we will be using the
  <font class="monospace"><b>C:\edk2</b></font> path for the
  <a href="https://edk2.tianocore.org">edk2</a> source tree.
</p>

<h2 class="main-title">
  Internet proxies
</h2>

<p class="build-step-details">
  If your network utilizes a firewall with a web proxy, then you may
  need to configure your proxy information for subversion to work.&nbsp;
  Ask your network administrator to find
  out the computer name and port to use for proxy setup and
  refer to the manual for your subversion software to find out how
  to configure the proxy information.&nbsp;
</p>

<h2 class="main-title">
  Get the edk2 source tree and build MdeModulePkg
</h2>

<h3 class="build-step-title">
  Checkout the edk2 source tree from subversion
</h3>

<p class="build-step-details">
  If you use the command line version of subversion, then you can easily
  checkout the edk2 to the <font class="monospace">C:\edk2</font>
  directory with the following command:
</p>

<pre class="build-step-code">
C:\> <b>svn co ^
  https://edk2.tianocore.org/svn/edk2/trunk/edk2 ^
  C:\edk2 ^
  --username guest</b>
</pre>

<h3 class="build-step-title">
  Setup build shell environment
</h3>

<pre class="build-step-code">
C:\> <b>cd C:\edk2</b>
C:\edk2> <b>edksetup.bat</b>
</pre>

<h3 class="build-step-title">
  Modify Conf files
</h3>

<p class="build-step-details">
  You will need to edit the Conf\target.txt file.&nbsp;
  First, change the ACTIVE_PLATFORM to the MdeModulePkg:
</p>

<pre class="build-step-code">
C:\edk2> <b>notepad Conf\target.txt</b>
</pre>

<p class="build-step-details">
  ACTIVE_PLATFORM should look like this in Conf\target.txt:
</p>

<pre class="build-step-code">
ACTIVE_PLATFORM       = MdeModulePkg/MdeModulePkg.dsc
</pre>

<p class="build-step-details">
  Modify TOOL_CHAIN_TAG in target.txt for the toolchain installed on
  your system.&nbsp;
  There are many options, so review the tools_def.txt to
  find the appropriate toolchain for your system.&nbsp;
  Search for 'Supported Tool Chains' in tools_def.txt to see the
  valid options for TOOL_CHAIN_TAG.
</p>

<p class="build-step-details">
  Also, consider if you want to build a different processor architecture by
  changing the TARGET_ARCH value in target.txt.&nbsp;
  Please consider that certain toolchains only support building certain
  processor architectures.
</p>

<h3 class="build-step-title">
  Build Hello World!&nbsp; (and the rest of MdeModulePkg)
</h3>

<p class="build-step-details">
  Now you should be able to simply run the <i>build</i> command to compile
  the MdeModulePkg.
</p>

<pre class="build-step-code">
C:\edk2> <b>build</b>
</pre>

<p class="build-step-details">
  As a tangible result of the build, you should have the HelloWorld UEFI
  application.&nbsp;
  If you have a UEFI system available to you which matches the processor
  architecture that you built, then this application
  should be able to run successfully under the shell.
</p>

<pre class="build-step-code">
C:\edk2> <b>dir /s Build\MdeModule\HelloWorld.efi</b>
</pre>
