/**
  This service retrieves the number of logical processor in the platform
  and the number of those logical processors that are enabled on this boot.
  This service may only be called from the BSP.

  This function is used to retrieve the following information:
    - The number of logical processors that are present in the system.
    - The number of enabled logical processors in the system at the instant
      this call is made.

  Because MP Service Ppi provides services to enable and disable processors
  dynamically, the number of enabled logical processors may vary during the
  course of a boot session.

  If this service is called from an AP, then EFI_DEVICE_ERROR is returned.
  If NumberOfProcessors or NumberOfEnabledProcessors is NULL, then
  EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER is returned. Otherwise, the total number of processors
  is returned in NumberOfProcessors, the number of currently enabled processor
  is returned in NumberOfEnabledProcessors, and EFI_SUCCESS is returned.

  @param[in]  This                Pointer to this instance of the PPI.
  @param[out] NumberOfProcessors  Pointer to the total number of logical processors in
                                  the system, including the BSP and disabled APs.
  @param[out] NumberOfEnabledProcessors
                                  Number of processors in the system that are enabled.

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS             The number of logical processors and enabled
                                  logical processors was retrieved.
  @retval EFI_DEVICE_ERROR        The calling processor is an AP.
  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER   NumberOfProcessors is NULL.
                                  NumberOfEnabledProcessors is NULL.

/**
  This service executes a caller provided function on all enabled APs. APs can
  run either simultaneously or one at a time in sequence. This service supports
  both blocking requests only. This service may only
  be called from the BSP.

  This function is used to dispatch all the enabled APs to the function specified
  by Procedure.  If any enabled AP is busy, then EFI_NOT_READY is returned
  immediately and Procedure is not started on any AP.

  If SingleThread is TRUE, all the enabled APs execute the function specified by
  Procedure one by one, in ascending order of processor handle number. Otherwise,
  all the enabled APs execute the function specified by Procedure simultaneously.

  If the timeout specified by TimeoutInMicroSeconds expires before all APs return
  from Procedure, then Procedure on the failed APs is terminated. All enabled APs
  are always available for further calls to EFI_PEI_MP_SERVICES_PPI.StartupAllAPs()
  and EFI_PEI_MP_SERVICES_PPI.StartupThisAP(). If FailedCpuList is not NULL, its
  content points to the list of processor handle numbers in which Procedure was
  terminated.

  Note: It is the responsibility of the consumer of the EFI_PEI_MP_SERVICES_PPI.StartupAllAPs()
  to make sure that the nature of the code that is executed on the BSP and the
  dispatched APs is well controlled. The MP Services Ppi does not guarantee
  that the Procedure function is MP-safe. Hence, the tasks that can be run in
  parallel are limited to certain independent tasks and well-controlled exclusive
  code. PEI services and Ppis may not be called by APs unless otherwise
  specified.

  In blocking execution mode, BSP waits until all APs finish or
  TimeoutInMicroSeconds expires.

  @param[in] PeiServices          An indirect pointer to the PEI Services Table
                                  published by the PEI Foundation.
  @param[in] This                 A pointer to the EFI_PEI_MP_SERVICES_PPI instance.

                                  the system.
  @param[in] SingleThread         If TRUE, then all the enabled APs execute the function
                                  specified by Procedure one by one, in ascending order
                                  of processor handle number. If FALSE, then all the
                                  enabled APs execute the function specified by Procedure
                                  simultaneously.
  @param[in] TimeoutInMicroSeconds
                                  Indicates the time limit in microseconds for APs to
                                  return from Procedure, for blocking mode only. Zero
                                  means infinity. If the timeout expires before all APs
                                  return from Procedure, then Procedure on the failed APs
                                  is terminated. All enabled APs are available for next
                                  function assigned by EFI_PEI_MP_SERVICES_PPI.StartupAllAPs()
                                  or EFI_PEI_MP_SERVICES_PPI.StartupThisAP(). If the
                                  timeout expires in blocking mode, BSP returns
                                  EFI_TIMEOUT.
  @param[in] ProcedureArgument    The parameter passed into Procedure for all APs.

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS             In blocking mode, all APs have finished before the
