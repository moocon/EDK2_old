  @param  Buffer The buffer to copy to the allocated buffer.
  @param  Alignment The requested alignment of the allocation.  Must be a power of two.
  If Alignment is zero, then byte alignment is used.

  @return A pointer to the allocated buffer.  If AllocationSize is 0, then a valid buffer of 0 size is returned.
  If there is not enough memory remaining to satisfy the request, then NULL is returned.
