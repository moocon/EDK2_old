  Set Buffer to 0 for Size bytes.

  This function fills Length bytes of Buffer with zeros, and returns Buffer.

  If Buffer is NULL and Length > 0, then ASSERT().
  If Length is greater than (MAX_ADDRESS - Buffer + 1), then ASSERT().

  @param  Buffer Memory to set.
  @param  Size Number of bytes to set
