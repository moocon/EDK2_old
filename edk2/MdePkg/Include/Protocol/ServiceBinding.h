/**  
  @par Protocol Description:
  The EFI_SERVICE_BINDING_PROTOCOL provides member functions to create and destroy 
  child handles. A driver is responsible for adding protocols to the child handle 
  in CreateChild() and removing protocols in DestroyChild(). It is also required 
  that the CreateChild() function opens the parent protocol BY_CHILD_CONTROLLER 
  to establish the parent-child relationship, and closes the protocol in DestroyChild().
  The pseudo code for CreateChild() and DestroyChild() is provided to specify the 
  required behavior, not to specify the required implementation. Each consumer of 
  a software protocol is responsible for calling CreateChild() when it requires the 
  protocol and calling DestroyChild() when it is finished with that protocol.
