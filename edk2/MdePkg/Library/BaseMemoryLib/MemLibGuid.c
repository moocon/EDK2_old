/**
  Scans a target buffer for a GUID, and returns a pointer to the matching GUID
  in the target buffer.

  This function searches target the buffer specified by Buffer and Length from
  the lowest address to the highest address at 128-bit increments for the
  128-bit GUID value that matches Guid. If a match is found, then a pointer to
  the matching GUID in the target buffer is returned. If no match is found,
  then NULL is returned. If Length is 0, then NULL is returned.

  If Buffer is NULL, then ASSERT().
  If Buffer is not aligned on a 64-bit boundary, then ASSERT().
  If Length is greater than (MAX_ADDRESS - Buffer + 1), then ASSERT().

  @param  Buffer  Pointer to the target buffer to scan.
  @param  Length  Number of bytes in Buffer to scan.
  @param  Guid    Value to search for in the target buffer.

  @return Pointer to the first occurrence.
  @retval NULL  if Length == 0 or Guid was not found.
