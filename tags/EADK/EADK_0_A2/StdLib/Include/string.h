/** @file
  The header <string.h> declares one type and several functions, and defines
  one macro useful for manipulating arrays of character type and other objects
  treated as arrays of character type.  Various methods are used for
  determining the lengths of the arrays, but in all cases a char * or void *
  argument points to the initial (lowest addressed) character of the array. If
  an array is accessed beyond the end of an object, the behavior is undefined.

  Where an argument declared as size_t n specifies the length of the array for
  a function, n can have the value zero on a call to that function. Unless
  explicitly stated otherwise in the description of those functions, pointer
  arguments on such a call shall still have valid values.

  For all functions declared in this header, each character shall be
  interpreted as if it had the type unsigned char (and therefore every possible
  object representation is valid and has a different value).
