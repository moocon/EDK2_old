Routine Description:

  Calculate CRC32 for target data

Arguments:

  Data     - The target data.
  DataSize - The target data size.
  CrcOut   - The CRC32 for target data.

Returns:

  EFI_SUCCESS           - The CRC32 for target data is calculated successfully.
  EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER - Some parameter is not valid, so the CRC32 is not
                          calculated.

Routine Description:

  Determines the new virtual address that is to be used on subsequent memory accesses.

Arguments:

  DebugDisposition    - Supplies type information for the pointer being converted.
  ConvertAddress      - A pointer to a pointer that is to be fixed to be the value needed
                        for the new virtual address mappings being applied.

Returns:

  EFI_SUCCESS             - The pointer pointed to by Address was modified.
  EFI_NOT_FOUND           - The pointer pointed to by Address was not found to be part
                            of the current memory map. This is normally fatal.
  EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER   - One of the parameters has an invalid value.

/*++

Routine Description:

  Changes the runtime addressing mode of EFI firmware from physical to virtual.

Arguments:

  MemoryMapSize     - The size in bytes of VirtualMap.
  DescriptorSize    - The size in bytes of an entry in the VirtualMap.
  DescriptorVersion - The version of the structure entries in VirtualMap.
  VirtualMap        - An array of memory descriptors which contain new virtual
                      address mapping information for all runtime ranges.

Returns:

  EFI_SUCCESS           - The virtual address map has been applied.
  EFI_UNSUPPORTED       - EFI firmware is not at runtime, or the EFI firmware is already in
                          virtual address mapped mode.
  EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER - DescriptorSize or DescriptorVersion is invalid.
  EFI_NO_MAPPING        - A virtual address was not supplied for a range in the memory
                          map that requires a mapping.
  EFI_NOT_FOUND         - A virtual address was supplied for an address that is not found
                          in the memory map.

Routine Description:

  Install Runtime AP. This code includes the EfiRuntimeLib, but it only

Arguments:

  ImageHandle   - Image handle of this driver.
  SystemTable   - Pointer to the EFI System Table.

Returns:

  EFI_SUCEESS - Runtime Driver Architectural Protocol installed.
