    stdlib\libc\gdtoa\strtod.c(825) : warning C4789: destination of memory copy is too small
    runtime crashes when using floating-point formats with printf

2:  Compilation Error                       ALL               2012  Fixed 1/2012
    StdLib/LibC/Uefi/SysCalls.c: In function 'utimes': error: 'va_start' used in function with fixed args

3:  Usage Clarification                                       2012  Document
    Clarify that the current StdLib may not be used for developing drivers.

4:  Execution/Compile errors                                  2012  Fixed 1/2013
    Mismatch in use of EFIAPI between declaration and definition of some functions.

5:  Error message Quality during execution                    2012  Verified
    Performing filesystem operations when a filesystem driver has not been
    linked into the application results in hangs or error messages that are
    misleading or unclear as to the cause.

6:  Application error return                                  2012  Verified
    On error, applications will sometimes return large positive numbers.

7:  Compilation Error                       GCC46        Jan, 2013  Fixed 1/2013
    StdLib/LibC/Containers/Queues/Fifo.c:508:27: error: assignment from incompatible pointer type

9:  chdir/cwd not in EFI Shell                                2012  Understood
    The chdir and getcwd functions only work if one is using the UEFI Shell.

10: No current volume/directory at app. startup.              2012  Understood
    If the Shell does not have a current volume or directory, file operations
    may hang or fail.

11: printf("-%ls-", L"test") will only print "--"             2013  Fixed 3/2013
