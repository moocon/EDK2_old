/**
  This service retrieves the number of logical processor in the platform
  and the number of those logical processors that are enabled on this boot.
  This service may only be called from the BSP.

  This function is used to retrieve the following information:
    - The number of logical processors that are present in the system.
    - The number of enabled logical processors in the system at the instant
      this call is made.

  Because MP Service Ppi provides services to enable and disable processors
  dynamically, the number of enabled logical processors may vary during the
  course of a boot session.

  If this service is called from an AP, then EFI_DEVICE_ERROR is returned.
  If NumberOfProcessors or NumberOfEnabledProcessors is NULL, then
  EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER is returned. Otherwise, the total number of processors
  is returned in NumberOfProcessors, the number of currently enabled processor
  is returned in NumberOfEnabledProcessors, and EFI_SUCCESS is returned.

  @param[in]  This                Pointer to this instance of the PPI.
  @param[out] NumberOfProcessors  Pointer to the total number of logical processors in
                                  the system, including the BSP and disabled APs.
  @param[out] NumberOfEnabledProcessors
                                  Number of processors in the system that are enabled.

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS             The number of logical processors and enabled
                                  logical processors was retrieved.
  @retval EFI_DEVICE_ERROR        The calling processor is an AP.
  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER   NumberOfProcessors is NULL.
                                  NumberOfEnabledProcessors is NULL.

  Gets detailed MP-related information on the requested processor at the

    - The information presented here is entirely MP related.

  Information regarding the number of caches and their sizes, frequency of operation,
