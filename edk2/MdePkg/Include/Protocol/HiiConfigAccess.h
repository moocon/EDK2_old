/**
   
  This function allows the caller to request the current
  configuration for one or more named elements. The resulting
  string is in <ConfigAltResp> format. Any and all alternative
  configuration strings shall also be appended to the end of the
  current configuration string. If they are, they must appear
  after the current configuration. They must contain the same
  routing (GUID, NAME, PATH) as the current configuration string.
  They must have an additional description indicating the type of
  alternative configuration the string represents,
  "ALTCFG=<StringToken>". That <StringToken> (when
  converted from Hex UNICODE to binary) is a reference to a
  string in the associated string pack.

  @param This   Points to the EFI_HII_CONFIG_ACCESS_PROTOCOL.

  @param Request  A null-terminated Unicode string in
                  <ConfigRequest> format. Note that this
                  includes the routing information as well as
                  the configurable name / value pairs. It is
                  invalid for this string to be in
                  <MultiConfigRequest> format.

  @param Progress   On return, points to a character in the
                    Request string. Points to the string's null
                    terminator if request was successful. Points
                    to the most recent "&" before the first
                    failing name / value pair (or the beginning
                    of the string if the failure is in the first
                    name / value pair) if the request was not
                    successful

  @param Results  A null-terminated Unicode string in
                  <ConfigAltResp> format which has all values
                  filled in for the names in the Request string.
                  String to be allocated by the called function.

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS   The Results string is filled with the
                        values corresponding to all requested
                        names.

  @retval EFI_OUT_OF_MEMORY   Not enough memory to store the
                              parts of the results that must be
                              stored awaiting possible future
                              protocols.

  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER   For example, passing in a NULL
                                  for the Request parameter
                                  would result in this type of
                                  error. In this case, the
                                  Progress parameter would be
                                  set to NULL. 

  @retval EFI_NOT_FOUND   Routing data doesn't match any
                          known driver. Progress set to the
                          first character in the routing header.
                          Note: There is no requirement that the
                          driver validate the routing data. It
                          must skip the <ConfigHdr> in order to
                          process the names.

  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER   Illegal syntax. Progress set
                                  to most recent & before the
                                  error or the beginning of the
                                  string.

  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER   Unknown name. Progress points
                                  to the & before the name in
                                  question.

/**
   
  This function applies changes in a driver's configuration.
  Input is a Configuration, which has the routing data for this
  driver followed by name / value configuration pairs. The driver
  must apply those pairs to its configurable storage. If the
  driver's configuration is stored in a linear block of data
  and the driver????s name / value pairs are in <BlockConfig>
  format, it may use the ConfigToBlock helper function (above) to
  simplify the job.

  @param This   Points to the EFI_HII_CONFIG_ACCESS_PROTOCOL.

  @param Configuration  A null-terminated Unicode string in

/**
   
  This function is called to provide results data to the driver.

  This protocol provides a callable interface between the HII and

  to publish this protocol.

  @param ExtractConfig  This function breaks apart the UNICODE
                        request strings routing them to the
                        appropriate drivers. This function is
                        analogous to the similarly named
                        function in the HII Routing Protocol.
  
  @param RouteConfig  This function breaks apart the UNICODE
                      results strings and returns configuration
                      information as specified by the request.
  
  @param Callback   This function is called from the
