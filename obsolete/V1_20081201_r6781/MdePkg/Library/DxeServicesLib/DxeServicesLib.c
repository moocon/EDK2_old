/**
  Allocate and fill a buffer from a Firmware Section identified by a Firmware File GUID name, a Firmware 
  Section type and instance number from the specified Firmware Volume.

  This functions first locate the EFI_FIRMWARE_VOLUME2_PROTOCOL protocol instance on FvHandle in order to 
  carry out the Firmware Volume read operation. The function then reads the Firmware Section found sepcifed 
  by NameGuid, SectionType and SectionInstance. 
  
  The details of this search order is defined in description of EFI_FIRMWARE_VOLUME2_PROTOCOL.ReadSection () 
  found in PI Specification.
  
  If SectionType is EFI_SECTION_TE, EFI_SECTION_TE is used as section type to start the search. If EFI_SECTION_TE section 
  is not found, EFI_SECTION_PE32 will be used to try the search again. If no EFI_SECTION_PE32 section is found, EFI_NOT_FOUND 
  is returned.
  
  The data and size is returned by Buffer and Size. The caller is responsible to free the Buffer allocated 
  by this function. This function can be only called at TPL_NOTIFY and below.

  @param  SectionType             The Firmware Section type.
  @param  SectionInstance         The instance number of Firmware Section to read from starting from 0.
  @param  Buffer                  On output, Buffer contains the the data read from the section in the Firmware File found.
  @param  Size                    On output, the size of Buffer.

  @retval  EFI_SUCCESS            The image is found and data and size is returned.
